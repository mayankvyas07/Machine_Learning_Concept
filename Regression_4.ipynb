    "Q1. Lasso Regression and its Differences:\n",
    "Lasso (Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator) Regression is a linear regression technique that adds a penalty term proportional to the absolute values of the coefficients to the cost function. This penalty encourages some coefficients to become exactly zero, effectively performing feature selection. Lasso differs from other regression techniques like Ridge Regression and Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) by its ability to automatically select relevant features and eliminate irrelevant ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. Advantage of Lasso Regression in Feature Selection:\n",
    "The main advantage of using Lasso Regression for feature selection is its ability to automatically shrink the coefficients of less important features to exactly zero. This leads to a sparse model where only the most relevant features are retained, making the model simpler, more interpretable, and less prone to overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. Interpreting Coefficients in Lasso Regression:\n",
    "Interpreting coefficients in Lasso Regression is similar to interpreting coefficients in other linear regression techniques. A positive coefficient indicates that an increase in the corresponding independent variable is associated with an increase in the dependent variable, and vice versa. The magnitude of the coefficient indicates the strength of this relationship. However, due to the L1 penalty, some coefficients might be exactly zero, implying that the corresponding feature has been excluded from the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. Tuning Parameters in Lasso Regression:\n",
    "The main tuning parameter in Lasso Regression is the regularization parameter (lambda). It controls the strength of the penalty applied to the coefficients. A larger value of lambda increases the penalty, leading to more coefficients being pushed towards zero. A smaller value of lambda reduces the penalty, allowing more coefficients to retain their original values. Cross-validation techniques are commonly used to find the optimal value of lambda that balances model complexity and fit to the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. Lasso Regression for Non-linear Problems:\n",
    "Lasso Regression is inherently a linear regression technique, which means it's designed to capture linear relationships between independent and dependent variables. For non-linear problems, you might need to transform your features or explore other non-linear regression techniques like polynomial regression, kernel regression, or non-linear support vector machines.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6. Differences Between Ridge and Lasso Regression:\n",
    "Ridge and Lasso regressions both add penalty terms to the cost function to prevent overfitting, but they differ in how these penalties are applied. Ridge uses the squared values of coefficients (L2 penalty), which tends to shrink coefficients towards zero without making them exactly zero. Lasso uses the absolute values of coefficients (L1 penalty), leading to some coefficients becoming exactly zero, performing feature selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. Handling Multicollinearity in Lasso Regression:\n",
    "Lasso Regression can handle multicollinearity to some extent. Due to the L1 penalty, it tends to select one feature over another if they are highly correlated. In this way, Lasso can implicitly deal with multicollinearity by choosing one of the correlated features and driving the coefficients of the others to zero. However, it's not a perfect solution for severe multicollinearity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q8. Choosing the Optimal Value of the Regularization Parameter (lambda):\n",
    "Choosing the optimal value of lambda in Lasso Regression is usually done using techniques like cross-validation. Cross-validation involves splitting the dataset into training and validation sets multiple times, fitting the model with different lambda values, and evaluating its performance on the validation data. The lambda value that results in the best performance (e.g., the lowest mean squared error) on the validation sets is selected as the optimal value."
